<h1 style="text-align:justify">Study Information Sheet</h1>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">You are being asked to participate in a research study at the University of California, Irvine. <strong>Participation in this study is optional.&nbsp;</strong> You may choose to skip any question on this survey and still continue the study. You are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits by simply stopping the survey.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">We are inviting you to complete a survey that will help us learn more about the causes and characteristics of a disorder called misophonia, which involves emotional reactivity to sound. The survey will last about 45-60 minutes, you <strong>will not be able </strong>to save the study and return to it at a later time. <strong>You are able to take breaks as needed</strong>. The survey will explore the following areas:
	<ul>
		<li>Auditory testing regarding emotional reactivity to certain sounds</li>
		<li>Questionnaires in regards to emotional reactivity to sounds</li>
		<li>Personality traits&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Psychometric assessments pertaining to emotions, disgust, &amp; anxiety</li>
		<li>Basic demographic information<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">There are <strong>no direct benefits</strong> to you from participation in the study. However, this study may help us to understand more about <strong>misophonia</strong> and possibly develop interventions to reduce its negative impacts.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">One possible risk/discomfort with this study is <strong>fatigue</strong>.<em> </em>If you become tired, you may stop the survey at any point, and resume it at your leisure, <strong>please do not close the study page or your progress will be lost.</strong> Another possible risk/discomfort with this study is exposure to sounds that might trigger <strong>negative feelings</strong> like irritation, anger, disgust, or anxiety. You may take a break from listening to the sounds or answering any questions as needed.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">You will be asked to choose contact options at the end of the survey. If you do not want to be contacted for follow-up studies, your survey responses will be <strong>entirely anonymous</strong> with no connection to identifying information. If you choose to submit your name and email to participate in follow-up studies with our lab on this or other subjects, another possible risk/discomfort with this study is the <strong>potential for a breach of confidentiality</strong>. However, the survey includes few-to-no questions about sensitive data, and every effort will be made to keep your information <strong>confidential</strong>. <em>Confidential </em>means that a personal identifier exists, but is only linked to your responses through a separate private code. Personal identifiers that may be collected in this survey with your contact information are your name, email, and/or IP address.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">As <strong>compensation</strong>, you may choose at the end of the survey to enter a<strong> lottery to win a $20 Amazon gift card</strong> for your participation in this study.&nbsp;Gift cards will be provided at a rate of one for every 20 participants; you will therefore have a 1 in 20 chance of winning a gift card. Lotteries will be held approximately once a month throughout recruitment for the study or after 20 participants if that recruitment batch takes longer than a month. You will <strong>only receive one lottery entry</strong>, and your name will be included in the next lottery after you complete the survey. You will be prompted at the end of the survey to choose to enter your email to be included in the lottery. If you choose to enter the lottery, you will be redirected to a second survey to enter your contact information. Personal information provided for the lottery entry will NOT be associated with your main survey responses in any way.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>All research data collected will be encrypted and confidential</strong> on a secure server that is <strong>fully encrypted, fire-walled, and practicing all applicable security standards provided by the Office of Information Technology (OIT). </strong>This data is only available to the researchers listed at the top of this document. If provided for the lottery only, participant identifiers will be stored separately from the survey data with no links to your anonymous survey responses. Once your name and email are used for the lottery, that information will be erased. If provided for contact for follow-up studies, participant identifiers will be stored separately from the survey data and will only be associated with your data through a code. In this case, all participant identifiers will be destroyed at the completion of the study (including any related follow-up measurements). The anonymized data will be kept indefinitely for use in future studies.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Researchers will use the information you provide in this survey to conduct this study. Once the study is done using your information, we may share anonymous versions of it with other researchers so they can use the data for other studies in the future. We will not share your name or any other private identifiable information that would let the researchers know who you are. We will not ask you for additional permission to share this de-identified information.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Option to save survey and return later:</strong> Your progress through the survey is saved each time you move to the next page. If there is an unanswered question on the current page, you will be notified at that point so that you can complete it if you have not skipped it intentionally. If you would like to save the survey to take a break and return to it later, <strong>please do not close the browser</strong>. We thank you for your time and participation!<br />
